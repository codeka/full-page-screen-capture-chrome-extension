Full Page Screen Capture
========================

A simple Google Chrome extension that takes a screen capture of either a full web page or a selected area of the page.

### To Install

For development:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Chrome and go to the extensions page (Window → Extensions)
3. Enable developer mode (if it’s not already)
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension…”
5. Select the folder for this app

I don't have a public listing on the webstore, this is mostly for my own personal use.
